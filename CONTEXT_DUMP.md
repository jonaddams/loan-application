# NextJS Loan Application POC - Context Dump

## Current Status: Form Field Mapping Implementation

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Last Working On:** Enhanced field matching logic for automatic PDF form filling using Nutrient SDK

## What We've Built

### 1. **Core Application Structure**
- NextJS 14 app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- 3-step wizard: Welcome → Package Selection → Results
- Integration with XtractFlow API for document processing
- Nutrient SDK integration for PDF viewing and form field manipulation

### 2. **Document Processing Flow**
```
1. User selects loan package (package1, package2, or package3)
2. System processes documents via XtractFlow API:
   - /api/get-predefined-templates
   - /api/register-component  
   - /api/process (for each document)
3. Results page shows extracted data and PDF viewer
4. PDF form fields are automatically filled with extracted data
```

### 3. **Key Components**
- **`/src/app/results/page.tsx`** - Main results page with field matching logic
- **`/src/components/Viewer.tsx`** - Nutrient SDK PDF viewer with form filling
- **`/src/app/api/process-package/route.ts`** - Processes document packages
- **`/public/documents/package-1/`** - Sample loan application documents

## Current Implementation Details

### **Form Field Matching System**
Located in `/src/app/results/page.tsx` lines 150-240

**Logic:**
1. Extracts all fields from processed documents
2. Cleans PDF form field names (removes SDK prefixes like `id_abc123_`)
3. Matches using specific mapping patterns
4. Updates UI with visual indicators (✅ green checkmark / ❌ red X)
5. Passes matched data to PDF viewer for automatic form filling

**Current Field Mappings:**
```javascript
const specificMappings = [
  // Names
  { form: ["firstname", "first-name"], extracted: ["firstname"] },
  { form: ["lastname", "last-name"], extracted: ["lastname"] },
  { form: ["fullname", "full-name"], extracted: ["fullname", "name", "ownername"] },
  
  // License
  { form: ["licensenumber", "license-number"], extracted: ["licensenumber"] },
  
  // Financial
  { form: ["annualincome", "annual-income"], extracted: ["grosssalary"] },
  { form: ["bankname", "bank-name"], extracted: ["bankname"] },
  
  // Address
  { form: ["homeaddress", "home-address"], extracted: ["address", "owneraddress", "bankaddress"] },
  
  // Dates
  { form: ["dateofbirth", "date-of-birth"], extracted: ["birthdate"] },
  
  // ... more mappings
]
```

### **Current Working Status**
✅ **Working:** 5 fields successfully filled:
- License number: `11234568`
- Home address: `2500 Financial Center Drive, Sacramento, CA 95825` 
- Date of birth: `08/31/1977`
- First name: `IMA`
- Last name: `CARDHOLDER`

❌ **Issues Identified:**
- Some form fields have malformed names like `vehicle-vin_vehicle-vin` (duplicate)
- Bank address being mapped to home address field (needs separation)
- Missing mappings for available extracted data like `Bank name`, `Gross salary`
- Vehicle information not being extracted/mapped

## Available Extracted Data

From console logs, these fields are available:
```
- Birth date ✅ (working)
- Country
- First name ✅ (working) 
- Last name ✅ (working)
- License number ✅ (working)
- Employee first name
- Employee last name  
- Gross salary (should map to annual-income)
- Net salary (should map to monthly-income)
- Pay date
- Period beginning
- Period ending
- Account number
- Bank address ✅ (working but wrong field)
- Bank name (should map to bank-name field)
- Currency
- Owner address ✅ (working)
- Owner name
```

## Technical Architecture

### **Form Field Auto-Fill Process**
1. **Results Page** (`page.tsx`) matches fields with `matchFormFieldsWithData()`
2. **Viewer Component** (`Viewer.tsx`) receives `fieldData` prop
3. **PDF loads**, form fields are detected
4. **Separate useEffect** calls `fillFormFieldsWithData()` with matched data
5. **Nutrient SDK** fills fields using:
   ```javascript
   const formFieldValue = new NutrientViewer.FormFieldValue({
     name: field.name,
     value: field.extractedValue
   });
   await instance.update(formFieldValue);
   ```

### **Document Structure**
- **Package 1:** Auto loan (Ima Cardholder) - California driver's license
- **Package 2:** Personal loan (Joseph Sample) - Florida driver's license  
- **Package 3:** Home improvement (Sarah Martin) - Canadian passport

Each package contains:
- Driver's license/passport
- Pay stub
- Employment letter (packages 2&3)
- Bank statement
- Loan application form (HTML → PDF via Nutrient SDK)

## Recent Changes Made

### **1. Fixed Infinite Loop Issue** 
- Separated PDF loading from field data updates
- Added `instanceRef` to store SDK instance
- Two separate `useEffect` hooks prevent re-rendering loop

### **2. Enhanced Field Matching Logic**
- Replaced broad fuzzy matching with specific field mappings
- Added precise patterns to prevent cross-contamination
- Enhanced debug logging for troubleshooting

### **3. Removed Placeholder Text**
- Cleaned all `placeholder` attributes from HTML forms
- Fixed email input type from `type="te"` to `type="email"`

### **4. HTML Form Structure Improvements**
- Each logical section on separate page with `page-break-after: always`
- Individual section borders instead of document-wide border
- Proper form field styling and validation attributes

## Next Steps / TODO

### **Immediate Priority:**
1. **Fix malformed field names** - Investigate why some fields have `field_field` pattern
2. **Add missing mappings** for available extracted data:
   - Bank name → bank-name field
   - Gross salary → annual-income field
   - Account number → account-number field
3. **Separate address mappings** - Bank address vs Home address
4. **Add vehicle information extraction** - Currently no vehicle data being extracted

### **Field Mapping Refinements:**
- Add employer name mapping (`Employee first name` + `Employee last name` → `employer-name`)
- Map pay period dates to employment fields
- Add currency formatting for financial fields
- Handle date format conversions

### **UI/UX Improvements:**
- Show extraction confidence scores
- Add manual field override capability  
- Improve visual feedback for successful fills
- Add export functionality for completed forms

## Debug Information

**Console Logs Pattern:**
```
🔍 Matching field: "id_abc123_field-name" -> cleaned: "field-name"
  🔎 Comparing with extracted: "Field Name" -> cleaned: "fieldname"  
  ✅ Specific mapping found: field-name -> fieldname
  🎯 Final match: "id_abc123_field-name" -> "Field Name" = "value"
```

**Successful Fill Pattern:**
```
🔧 Filling form fields with extracted data...
✅ Filled field 'id_abc123_field-name' with value 'extracted_value'
🎉 Successfully filled X form fields
```

This context dump should provide everything needed to resume development and continue improving the field matching system.
